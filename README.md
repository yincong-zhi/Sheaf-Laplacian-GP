# Learning Sheaf Laplacian for Graph GP

Main implementation using the same splits as Transductive Kernels for Gaussian Processes on Graphs <code>sheaf_gp.py</code>

Split from Neural Sheaf Diffusion can be found in <code>sheaf_gp_nsd.py</code> with data defined in <code>SNNsplit.py</code>, raw files are found in <code>splits</code> folder

Various kernels can be found in <code>kernels.py</code>
